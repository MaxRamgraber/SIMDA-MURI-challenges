Here the considered toy problem seeks to build the description of a 1D spatial field composed of different types, shapes, and properties of ice. In this context, this script aims to generate 1D sea ice fields. It returns the ice thickness field (reference), sparse elevation field (ICESat-2-like data), average elevation field (CryoSat-2-like data), and intensity field (SAR-like data)."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UucPXfo2BcbN"},"source":["## 1D Block class\n","\n","In order to efficiently manage the properties of sea ice regions, we make the modeling assumption that a sea ice region is composed of a juxtaposition of blocks that share the same characteristics but different properties. This assumption will help build simulated sea ice formed by these elementary blocks (finite element type approach). A block of ice in this code is parametrized as follows:\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"block1d_class.png\" alt=\"Block class\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","\n","The geometry of a block is defined by a length `l` and depth `hi_o`. To refine the parametrization of block geometry, a block object is also defined with a function `f_hit` describing the geometry of the interface between the top ice and snown and `f_hib` describing the geometry of the surface of the bottom ice. For the snow depth on top of the ice, the property `f_hs` describe the snow repartition on top of the ice. By default, the block object is defined at the origin of the spatial domain with the property `x_o=0`. Other properties are assumed to be constant (for now) inside the block and are used for the freeboard model and to model the light intensity captured in a SAR image."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":383},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":986,"status":"error","timestamp":1652818458771,"user":{"displayName":"Paul-Baptiste RUBIO","userId":"15146079832390040200"},"user_tz":240},"id":"YtyfrRhABcbO","outputId":"9d8fefa3-9b18-4d16-be26-32bf1f998db5"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import required packages\n","#!/usr/bin/env python3\n","# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n","\"\"\"\n","@author: rubiop\n","\"\"\"\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","from Block1DBase import BlockType, Block1D\n","from IceRegionBase import IceRegion\n","from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\n","from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF\n","from scipy.stats import norm\n","from scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n","\n","np.random.seed(25604)\n","\n","plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 310\n","plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 350"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ehfd6WJKp-Ru"},"source":["## Three types of sea ice"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-wcaUX48p-Ru"},"source":["For this example we define 3 types: First-Year Ice, Multi-Year Ice and Water. \n","Each type has its own characteristics that can be defined by statistical knwoledge.\n","\n","<img src=\"values_biblio.png\" alt=\"Biblio parameters\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","Most difficult properties to specify are top and bottom ice interfaces.
