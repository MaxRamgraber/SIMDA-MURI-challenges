Problem 3a: Data Assimilation with Known Kinematics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An extension of the Lagrangian mapping approach in Problem 2 is to explicitly treat the problem dynamically using the velocity field to evolve the ice state.   This is a building block towards Problem 3b, which uses a physics-based model for evolving the ice state (e.g., thickness). 

Here we formulate a filtering problem in the Eulerian framework with ice thickness $h_I(x,t)$ as the state variable. We model the thickness as being advected according to a known velocity field. Potential avenues for obtaining this velocity field include 

* Synthetic data generated by the numerical solution of a PDE
* Satellite-based data as employed in Problem 2

Ignoring any thermodynamic thickening, the dynamics of the system are governed by the advection equation 

.. math:: 
    :name: advection 
    \frac{\partial h_I}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (h_I v) = 0

Note that this model is similar to the continuity equation used in some sea ice models (see e.g., [Hibler1979]_).  At any instance in time, the likelihood functions developed for Problem 1 could be used to relate the thickness $h_I$ to observations.

Problem 3b: Data Assimilation with Physics-Based Dynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As an extension of Problem 3a, in Problem 3b we replace the velocity-field-governed advection of :ref:`advection` with physics-based dynamics. The likelihood functions developed in Problem 1 can still be employed in data assimilation, but the model for ice dynamics will now capture evolution of the thickness field in addition to advection. The model will also provide information about internal ice stress, which is valuable for navigation purposes.   

The choice of model is still open.  \cite{Feltham2008} provides a good overview of continuum based models. \cite{Dansereau2016} and \cite{olason2021new} provide an introduction to more recent efforts in continuum modeling with brittle rheologies.  \cite{hunke2017cice} describes a model used in operation by the Navy.  Recent work in the discrete element modeling of sea ice include \cite{damsgaard2018application} and \cite{west2021improving}.  In particular, \cite{chen2021lagrangian} describes a data assimilation technique for discrete element models developed by the Courant-based sea ice MURI project. As a further extension of this problem, any subset of these models could be employed simultaneously within a multifidelity data assimilation framework.
