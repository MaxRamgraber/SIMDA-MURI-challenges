`Tutorial - Generate simulated sea ice field`_ This tutorial shows how to generate simulated data which "looks like" data available for sea ice characterization.

`Tutorial - Data assimilation of sea ice thickness`_ In this tutorial, we use 3DVar to assimilate sea ice thickness using known kinematics.
